# Capstone-Project

Vansbrosimningen is a yearly open air swimming competition. Because itâ€™s held outdoors the swimming
conditions can vary very much from year to year. With Vansbroappen you can analyse your
performance by comparing your results to the top three swimmers and thereby get a more
meaningful assessment of your performance.

This is the final project I completed as part of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.
